    help:
      email_html: If you have difficulty using this form or need the form in a different format, send an email to <a href="mailto:govuk-forms@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">govuk-forms@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a> - include the name of the form in your email.
      heading: What to do if you have difficulty using this form
    inset_text_html: This form is part of the wider GOV.UK website. There’s a separate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/help/accessibility-statement">accessibility statement for the main GOV.UK website</a>.
    limitations:
      departmental_responsibility: The questions in the form are written by people in government departments and agencies. Each department and agency which publishes content on GOV.UK is responsible for making sure it meets the accessibility regulations. However, the text used in the form might not be plain language and the structure may not be fully accessible.
      forms_issues: Issues relating to the GOV.UK Forms interface are listed in ‘Technical information about this form’s accessibility’ below.
      guidance: To encourage accessible content we provide guidance within the GOV.UK Forms platform. We also use feedback and analytics to identify accessibility issues.
      heading: How accessible this form is
      some_inaccessible_text: Some parts of this form may not be fully accessible.
    non_accessible_content:
      heading: Non accessible content
      non_compliance:
        heading: Non compliance with the accessibility regulations
        repeated_questions: You may be asked for the same personal information more than once. This does not meet WCAG 2.2 criterion 3.3.7 (redundant entry).
        resolution_timeline: We plan to resolve this by the end of 2024.
      other_problems:
        heading: Other problems using the interface
        other_problems_list:
          list_item_0: The confirmation email error summary on the ‘Check your answers’ page does not link to the specific field that’s in error. This makes it harder to navigate within the page and to understand how to solve the problem.
          list_item_1: When there’s a validation error on the ‘Check your answers’ page, the page title does not change to include the word ‘Error’ at the start. If you’re using a screen reader this makes it harder to understand that you’re on an error page when the page refreshes.
          list_item_2: When you click on ‘Get help with this form’, the contact method headings are H3s, but there are no H2s. Skipping heading levels can be confusing if you’re using a screen reader and is not best practice.
          list_item_3: On question pages, the back link disappears when there’s an error present. This could make it harder to navigate out of pages when you’ve made a mistake.
          list_item_4: Where there’s an option to add someone’s title on name questions, the title input is not marked as optional. This could cause you to fill out this field when you do not want or need to.
          list_item_5:
            list_item_0: guidance that’s provided before a question
            list_item_1: summary list content on the ‘Check your answers’ page
            list_item_2: some of the content on the page confirming that your form’s been submitted
            list_item_3: some headings on question pages that have multiple fields
            preamble: 'VoiceOver on iOS (iPhone Operating System) 17 reads out some lines of content twice. This happens with:'
          list_item_6: When you click on ‘Get help with this form’, VoiceOver on iOS 17 does not announce that there’s more content to be shown. This could make it harder to get help with the form.
          list_item_7: On the ‘Check your answers’ page, VoiceOver on iOS 17 does not doesn't always read out the 'Change' link. This could make it harder for you to change your answer.
          list_item_8: It can be difficult to open the ‘Get help with this form’ link when using the Dragon web extension on Chrome. This could make it harder to get help with the form.
        preamble: Although the following issues do not fail WCAG 2.2 AA, we plan to investigate and fix them as soon as possible.
      preamble: The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
    preamble: This accessibility statement applies to online forms with a URL that starts with https://submit.forms.service.gov.uk.
