module Flow
  ##
  # This class represents the journey taken by a form filler through a form.
  #
  # For a simple form (with no routing) there is only one possible set of
  # steps that a form filler can take, but for a form with routing there
  # may be some pages that the form filler never sees.
  #
  # Journey#completed_steps is an array of the steps that the form filler has
  # visited so far in the form, in the order defined by the form. If their
  # answer to a question page step causes a routing rule to be applied, for
  # instance by skipping over the next two questions, only the questions in the
  # resulting route are included.
  #
  # Note: the completed_steps array is ordered, from start to last step
  # answered; if the form filler has not yet visited the forms first page the
  # array will be empty.
