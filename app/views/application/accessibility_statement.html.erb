    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Using this form</h2>

    <p>
      This form was created using a platform called
      <a href="http://www.gov.uk/forms">GOV.UK Forms</a>. GOV.UK Forms is built
      by the Government Digital Service (GDS). It is designed to create forms
      that can be used by as many people as possible.
    </p>

    <p>The text in the form should be clear and simple to understand.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How accessible this form is</h2>

    <p>Some parts of this form may not be fully accessible.</p>

    <p>
      The questions in the form are written by people in government departments
      and agencies. Each department and agency which publishes content on GOV.UK
      is responsible for making sure it meets the accessibility regulations.
      However, the text used in the form might not be plain language and the
      structure may not be fully accessible.
    </p>

    <p>
      To encourage accessible content we provide guidance within the GOV.UK
      Forms platform. We also use feedback and analytics to identify
      accessibility issues.

      Accessibility Regulations 2018.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Compliance status</h3>

    <p>
      This form is partially compliant with the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/"
        >Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard</a
      >, due to the non-compliances listed below.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non accessible content</h2>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Non compliance with the accessibility regulations
    </h3>

    <p>
      Some form inputs ask for information without the appropriate autocomplete
      attributes. This means that they won’t be automatically filled by the
      browser. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.5 (identify
      input purpose).
    </p>

    <p>
      We plan to add autocomplete for the most common answer types by April
      2023.
    </p>
