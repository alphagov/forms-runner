      Technical information about this form’s accessibility
    </h2>

    <p>
      GDS is committed to making this form accessible, in accordance with the
      Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2)
      Accessibility Regulations 2018.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Compliance status</h3>

    <p>
      This form is partially compliant with the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/"
        >Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard</a>, due to the non-compliances listed below.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non accessible content</h2>

    <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Non compliance with the accessibility regulations
    </h3>

    <p>
      You may be asked for the same personal information more than once. This does not meet WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.3.7 (redundant entry).
    </p>

    <p>
      We plan to resolve this by the end of 2024.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Other problems using the interface
    </h3>

    <p>
      Although the following issues do not fail WCAG 2.2 AA, we plan to investigate and fix them as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
      <li>The confirmation email error summary on the ‘Check your answers’ page does not link to the specific field that’s in error. This makes it harder to navigate within the page and to understand how to solve the problem.</li>
      <li>When there’s a validation error on the ‘Check your answers’ page, the page title does not change to include the word ‘Error’ at the start. If you’re using a screen reader this makes it harder to understand that you’re on an error page when the page refreshes.</li>
      <li>When you click on ‘Get help with this form’, the contact method headings are H3s, but there are no H2s. Skipping heading levels can be confusing if you’re using a screen reader and is not best practice.</li>
      <li>On question pages, the back link disappears when there’s an error present. This could make it harder to navigate out of pages when you’ve made a mistake.</li>
      <li>Where there’s an option to add someone’s title on name questions, the title input is not marked as optional. This could cause you to fill out this field when you do not want or need to.</li>
      <li>VoiceOver on iOS (iPhone Operating System) 17 reads out some lines of content twice. This happens with:
        <ul>
          <li>guidance that’s provided before a question</li>
          <li>summary list content on the ‘Check your answers’ page</li>
          <li>some of the content on the page confirming that your form’s been submitted</li>
          <li>some headings on question pages that have multiple fields</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>When you click on ‘Get help with this form’, VoiceOver on iOS 17 does not announce that there’s more content to be shown. This could make it harder to get help with the form.</li>
      <li>On the ‘Check your answers’ page, VoiceOver on iOS 17 does not doesn't always read out the 'Change' link. This could make it harder for you to change your answer.</li>
      <li>It can be difficult to open the ‘Get help with this form’ link when using the Dragon web extension on Chrome. This could make it harder to get help with the form.</li>
    </ol>
