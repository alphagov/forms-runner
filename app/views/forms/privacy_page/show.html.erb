    <p>Last updated: 20 September 2022</p>
    <p>
      This form was created using GOV.UK Forms. GOV.UK Forms is a product
      provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS) which is part of the
      Cabinet Office. It lets UK government teams create online forms to collect
      information from people and organisations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The organisation that created this online form using GOV.UK Forms is the
      data controller of personal data they collect using the form, whilst the
      Cabinet Office, through GDS, is the data processor. The data controller
      must tell you about what they are doing with your personal data -
      <%= govuk_link_to @privacy_policy_url do %>read the data controller’s privacy information for this form<% end %>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Cabinet Office also collects some data as a data controller. This
      privacy notice explains what personal data the Cabinet Office collects and
      processes as a data controller through forms made with GOV.UK Forms.

      Data we collect from you and what we do with it
    </h2>

    <p>When you use this form your device sends information such as your:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/support/browsers"
          >web browser</a
        >
        and version number
      </li>
      <li>time zone and language settings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We use this information to:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>give you the information and web pages you request</li>
      <li>monitor the use of the site for security threats</li>
      <li>
        monitor the performance of the site to identify inefficiencies and
        JavaScript errors
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We collect this information in system logs. These logs are stored in
      Amazon Web Services in Ireland.
    </p>

    <p>
      We move some of this information to our security and network monitoring
      tools in Ireland and the USA which are provided by companies acting as our
      data processors.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may also use this information to produce anonymised reports about the
      GOV.UK Forms service. This helps us understand where we can make
      improvements. We may share this information with the data controller of
      the form.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you email us feedback about this form, we’ll collect your email address
      and any other personal information you choose to include in your email.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may share your data with data controllers where it is appropriate. For
      example, if you provide feedback that relates to their function or if you
      make a data protection request.
    </p>

    <p>The legal basis for processing this data is that it’s necessary:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>to perform a task in the public interest</li>
      <li>in the exercise of our functions as a government department</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will not:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
      <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We will share your data if we are required to do so by law – for example,
      by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Cookies</h2>

    <p>
      We use cookies to make this form work.
      <%= govuk_link_to cookies_path do %>
Read about the cookies we use<% end %>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we keep your data</h2>

    <p>We will only keep your personal data for as long as:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the law requires us to</li>
      <li>we need it for the purposes listed above</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This means that we will only hold your personal data for one year.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Where your data is processed and stored
    </h2>

    <p>
      Your personal data may be transferred outside the United Kingdom while
      being processed by GDS. If this happens, we’ll make sure you’re given the
      same level of technical and legal protection as you are within the United
      Kingdom by relying on the UK Government’s data adequacy decisions or by
      including clauses in contracts that require the recipient to protect the
      data in accordance with UK standards.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      How we protect your data and keep it secure
    </h2>

    <p>
      We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. To
      prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place technical
      and organisational procedures to secure the data we collect about you –
      for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption. We
      also make sure that any third parties that we deal with have an obligation
      to keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Children’s privacy protection</h2>

    <p>
      We understand the importance of protecting children’s privacy online. Our
      services are not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children 13
      years of age or younger. It is not our policy to intentionally collect or
      maintain data about anyone under the age of 13.

        structured, commonly used and machine-readable format
