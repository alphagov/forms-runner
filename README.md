# GOV.UK Forms Runner [![Tests](https://github.com/alphagov/forms-runner/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alphagov/forms-runner/actions/workflows/test.yml)

GOV.UK Forms is a service for creating forms. GOV.UK Forms Runner is a an application which displays those forms to end users so that they can be filled in. It's a Ruby on Rails application without a database. It uses Redis for state.

## Before you start

To run the project, you will need to install:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - we use version 3 of Ruby. Before running the project, double check the [.ruby-version](.ruby-version) file to see the exact version.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - the frontend build requires Node.js. We use Node 20 LTS versions.

We recommend using a version manager to install and manage these, such as:

- [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [RVM](https://rvm.io/) for Ruby
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node.js
- [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) for both

## Getting started

### Installing for the first time

```bash
# 1. Clone the git repository and change directory to the new folder
git clone git@github.com:alphagov/forms-runner.git
cd forms-runner

# 2. Run the setup script
./bin/setup
```

### Running the app

You can either run the development task:

```bash
# Run the foreman dev server. This will also start the frontend dev task
./bin/dev
```

or run the rails server:

```bash
# Run a local Rails server
./bin/rails server

# When running the server, you can use any of the frontend tasks, e.g.:
npm run dev
```

You will also need to run the [forms-api service](https://github.com/alphagov/forms-api), as this app needs the API to create and access forms.

#### Getting AWS credentials

If you have access to the `readonly` role in the development environment can start the Rails server, locally, with the same set of permissions in use in the development AWS account. This allows you to test features like file upload to AWS S3 and sending emails via AWS SES.

1. Assume the `readonly` role in the development AWS account:
    ```
    gds aws forms-dev-readonly --shell
    ```
2. Start the Rails server with the `ASSUME_DEV_IAM_ROLE` environment variable
    ```
    ASSUME_DEV_IAM_ROLE=true ./bin/rails server
    ```

## Development tools

### Running the tests

The app tests are written with [rspec-rails], and you can run them with:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

[rspec-rails]: https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails

### Linting

We use [RuboCop GOV.UK] for linting code. To autocorrect issues, run:

```bash
bundle exec rubocop -A
```

We also use the [i18n-tasks] tool to keep our locales files in a consistent order. When the tests run, they will check if the locale files are normalised and fail if they are not. To fix the locale files automatically, you can run:

```bash
bundle exec i18n-tasks normalize
```

On GitHub pull requests, we also check our dependencies for security issues using [bundler-audit]. You can run this locally with:

```bash
bundle audit
```

[RuboCop GOV.UK]: https://github.com/alphagov/rubocop-govuk
[i18n-tasks]: https://github.com/glebm/i18n-tasks
[bundle-audit]: https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit

### Running tasks with Rake

We have a [Rakefile](./Rakefile) that is set up to follow the [GOV.UK conventions for Rails applications].

To lint your changes and run tests with one command, you can run:

```bash
bundle exec rake
```

[GOV.UK conventions for Rails applications]: https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/configure-linting.html#configuring-rails

## Changing configuration

### Changing settings

Refer to the [the config gem](https://github.com/railsconfig/config#accessing-the-settings-object) to understand the `file based settings` loading order.

To override `file based settings` through `Machine based env variables settings`, you can run:

```bash
cat config/settings.yml
file
  based
    settings
      env1: 'foo'
```

```bash
export SETTINGS__FILE__BASED__SETTINGS__ENV1="bar"
```

```ruby
puts Settings.file.based.setting.env1
bar
```

Refer to the [settings file](config/settings.yml) for all the settings required to run this app

### Environment variables

| Name        | Purpose                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| `REDIS_URL` | The URL for Redis (optional) |

### Feature flags

This repo supports the ability to set up feature flags. To do this, add your feature flag in the [settings file](config/settings.yml) under the `features` property. eg:

```yaml
features:
  some_feature: true
```

You can then use the [feature service](app/service/feature_service.rb) to check whether the feature is enabled or not. Eg. `FeatureService.enabled?(:some_feature)`.

You can also nest features:

```yaml
features:
  some:
    nested_feature: true
```

And check with `FeatureService.enabled?("some.nested_feature")`.

#### Enabling feature flags for specific forms

You can also enable a feature flag just for specific form(s) by providing a list of form IDs.

```yaml
features:
  some_feature:
    enabled: false
    enabled_for_form_ids: "123,456"
```

The `features.some_features.enabled` key sets the default for the flag for all forms.

You can enable the feature just for specific forms by adding the form ID to the `enabled_for_form_ids` comma separated string. Then check whether the flag is enabled for a form with `FeatureService.enabled?(:some_feature, form)` in the code.

The list of form IDs should only be populated by setting the environment variable `SETTINGS__FEATURES__SOME_FEATURE__ENABLED_FOR_FORM_IDS` via Terraform in forms-deploy, to avoid mistakenly enabling CSV submissions for unrelated forms in different environments.

### Testing with features

You can also tag RSpec tests with `feature_{name}: true`. This will turn that feature on just for the duration of that test.

### Configuring Redis

You can enable Redis sessions by providing the Redis connection URL in the environment variable `REDIS_URL`.

### Configuring GOV.UK Notify

We use [GOV.UK Notify] to send emails from our apps.

If you want to test the Notify functionality locally, you will need to get a test API key from the Notify service. Add it as an environment variable under `SETTINGS__GOVUK_NOTIFY__API_KEY` or add it to a local config file:

```
# config/settings.local.yml

# Settings for GOV.UK Notify api & email templates
govuk_notify:
  api_key: <API key from Notify>
```

[GOV.UK Notify]: https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/

### Configuring Sentry

We use [Sentry] to catch and alert us about exceptions in production apps.

We currently have a very basic setup for Sentry in this repo for testing, which we will continue to build upon.

In order to use Sentry locally, you will need to:

1. Sign in to Sentry using your work Google account.
2. Create a new project.
3. Add the Sentry DSN to your environment as `SETTINGS__SENTRY__DSN`, or add it to a local config file:

```
# config/settings.local.yml

sentry:
  DSN: <DSN from Sentry>
```

If you want to deliberately raise an exception to test, uncomment out the triggers in the [Sentry initializer script](config/initializers/sentry.rb). Whenever you run the app, errors will be raised and should also come through on Sentry.

[Sentry]: https://sentry.io

### Configuring Solid Queue

We use [Solid Queue] as an adapter for Active Job in deployed environments to run delayed and recurring jobs. Locally, Active Job will use the Async adapter by default, which supports running delayed jobs such as sending submission emails, but not recurring jobs.

In order to test recurring jobs, uncomment the lines in [development.rb](config/environments/development.rb) that set Solid Queue as the Active Job adapter:

```rb
  config.active_job.queue_adapter = :solid_queue
  config.solid_queue.connects_to = { database: { writing: :queue } }
```

Then start Solid queue by running

```bash
./bin/jobs
```

On a Mac, you may encounter the process crashing with the error `[__NSCFConstantString initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called.`

To fix, this you can set `PGGSSENCMODE=disable` - see this [GitHub rails issue](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/38560#issuecomment-1881733872).

```bash
PGGSSENCMODE=disable ./bin/jobs
```

If the jobs you need to test interact with AWS, follow the instructions for [Getting AWS credentials](#getting-aws-credentials)

[Solid Queue]: https://github.com/rails/solid_queue

## Deploying apps

The forms-runner app is containerised (see [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)) and can be deployed in the same way you'd normally deploy a containerised app.

We host our apps using Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can [read about how deployments happen on our team wiki](https://github.com/alphagov/forms-team/wiki/Deploying-code-changes-AWS), if you have access.

### Logging

- You should configure HTTP access logs in [the application config](./config/application.rb), using [Lograge](https://github.com/roidrage/lograge).
- You should use the [LogEventService](./app/services/log_event_service.rb) and [EventLogger](./app/lib/event_logger.rb) to create any custom log messages. This is independent of any Lograge configuration.
- The output format is JSON, using the [JsonLogFormatter](./app/lib/json_log_formatter.rb) to enable simpler searching and visbility, especially in Splunk.
- Do not use [log_tags](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-log-tags), as it breaks the JSON formatting produced by Lograge.

### Updating Docker files

To update the version of [Alpine Linux] and Ruby used in the Dockerfile, use the [update_app_versions.sh script in forms-deploy](https://github.com/alphagov/forms-deploy/blob/main/support/update_app_versions.sh)

[Alpine Linux]: https://www.alpinelinux.org/

### Working with pipelines
You can work with the forms-runner pipelines in different environments using Rake tasks

#### Pause
To pause the pipeline in an environment, run

```shell
rake pipeline:ENV:pause
```

where `ENV` is the name of the environment you want to work with, for example `dev` or `prod`.

#### Unpause
To unpause the pipeline in an environment, run

```shell
rake pipeline:ENV:unpause
```

where `ENV` is the name of the environment you want to work with, for example `dev` or `prod`.

#### Find out if a pipeline is paused
To find out if the pipeline in an environment is paused, run

```shell
rake pipeline:ENV:status
```

where `ENV` is the name of the environment you want to work with, for example `dev` or `prod`.
