Description:
    Generates a custom ViewComponent in the components directory with a view.rb 
    and a html template. Also creates a spec file and preview. Can be configured
    to add a ass partial, javascript file and javascript test.

Example:
    bin/rails generate custom_component Thing

    This will create:
        app/components/thing_component/view.rb
        app/components/thing_component/view.html.erb
        spec/components/thing_component/thing_component_preview.rb
        spec/components/thing_component/view_spec.rb


    bin/rails generate custom_component Thing --css

    This will create:
        app/components/thing_component/view.rb
        app/components/thing_component/view.html.erb
        app/components/thing_component/_index.scss
        spec/components/thing_component/thing_component_preview.rb
        spec/components/thing_component/view_spec.rb
        
    If you want your styles to be rendered, you'll need to import the generated 
    .scss file in `app/frontend/entrypoints/application.scss` or one of the scss
    files it imports.


    bin/rails generate custom_component Thing --javascript

    This will create:
        app/components/thing_component/view.rb
        app/components/thing_component/view.html.erb
        app/components/thing_component/index.js
        app/components/thing_component/index.test.js
        spec/components/thing_component/thing_component_preview.rb
        spec/components/thing_component/view_spec.rb
        
    If you want your JavaScript to work, you'll need to import the generated 
    index.js file in `app/frontend/entrypoints/application.js` or one of the JS
    files it imports.
